# opencore-dell-SSDT

`DSDT.dsl`
Access fields within embedded controller access 8-bits at a time. No need to patch it.

`SSDT-dGPU-Off.dsl`
Doesn't work or maybe right after sleep-wake(Need to test more).

`SSDT-PNLF.dsl`
Need to test if this has any advantages over the (pre-built)[https://github.com/dortania/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/blob/master/extra-files/compiled/SSDT-PNLF.aml]

`SSDT-GPIO.dsl`
Input works as expected.
